# Todo app
Basically the todo app, from the Advanced Web Development Udemy course, with additional functionality: 
- There's a done pile. Completed tasks will be pushed to the done pile. 
- Task ressurection. Tasks that are deleted can be brought back. 




## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites

You will need the following installed on your system
* [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org)
* [MongoDB]()
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

Clone the repo and install the dependencies in the command line:
```
npm install
```
/* 
Rename `nodemon.json-template` to `nodemon.json` and add your MongoDB connection to the environment variables:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "MONGODB_CONNECTION" : "mongodb://username:password@host1:port/dbname"
  }
}
*/
```
Then start the server (if using MongoDB locally, be sure to run it before starting the server):
```

npm run start
```
